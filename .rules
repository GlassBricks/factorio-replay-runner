This is a rust project broken into multiple crates.

## replay-script crate
This crate contains a tstl (TypescriptToLua) subproject in tstl_src/. tstl is managed by bun.sh.
tstl will compile typescript into lua files.
The lua files are included into rust with include_str!, automatically added by a build.rs script.
The main api is replay_script::ReplayScript, which implements Deserialize.

## Rust
Use idiomatic Rust.
This project does not use unsafe.
Prefer functional style programming:
- Prefer using iter() over for loops.
- When using result and option, prefer, such as map, and_then, or_else, ok_or_else, etc., over if statements and if let.
Leverage Rust's type system and zero-cost abstractions.

Never deeply nest functions; break them up into smaller, single-purpose functions.

Omit code comments entirely, except for documentation comments.

## Editing
Do not add extra documentation, sample usages, sample data, etc.; unless explicitly requested.

Do not give a final summary of steps done. Simply state the task is complete.
