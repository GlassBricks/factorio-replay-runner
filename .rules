## Overview
This is a rust project broken into multiple crates.

### replay-script crate
This crate contains a tstl (TypescriptToLua) subproject in tstl_src/. tstl is managed by bun.sh.
tstl will compile typescript to lua files.
The lua files are then include_str! into the rust crate.
This should be managed by the crates' build.rs.

## Rust
Use idiomatic Rust.
This project does not use unsafe.
Prefer functional style programming:
- Prefer using iter() over for loops.
- When using result and option, prefer, such as map, and_then, or_else, ok_or_else, etc., over if statements and if let.
Leverage Rust's type system and zero-cost abstractions.

Never deeply nest functions; break them up into smaller, single-purpose functions.
