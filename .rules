Use idiomatic Rust.
This project does not use unsafe.

Prefer functional style programming:
- Prefer using iter() over for loops.
- When using result and option, prefer combinators, such as map, and_then, or_else, ok_or_else, etc., over if statements and if let.

Leverage Rust's type system and zero-cost abstractions/wrappers
